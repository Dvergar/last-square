Reviving an old Ludum dare game...

- [ ] Redo the socket data buffering (what was that !?)
- [x] Basic graphic redesign
- [x] Responsive or fixed resolution
- [x] Refactor everything
- [x] Find back my rPi and host the game there
- [x] Fixed color generation
- [x] Change awful sounds
- [ ] Deterministic energy regen
- [ ] More visual feedback on the pointer

PS : Be careful, that's some unsexy jam code.
